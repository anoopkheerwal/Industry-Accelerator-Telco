## Microsoft Dynamics 365 Announces Industry Accelerators

Dynamics 365 announced the Microsoft Power Platform, a connected app platform that unifies access to your data to enable ISVs, SIs, Partners and Customers to build intelligent, data driven, task focused business and analytic applications. Microsoft is focused on enabling a data culture where the Microsoft Power Platform acts as the glue across Dynamics 365 (CE, F&O, Talent), Office 365 (SharePoint, Teams), Power BI, Power Apps, Microsoft Flow, Azure and other 3rd party on-premise and cloud based solutions.

With the Power Platform providing a unified approach to building data driven solutions, the team is taking it one step further by introducing Industry Solution Accelerators. Accelerators are industry focused foundational components that enable ISVs and other solution providers, a way to build solutions that are based on industry standards supported and driven by Microsoft. Along with our Telecommunication Accelerator, which you can read about here, we are focused on delivering accelerators for other industries for which you can find more detail in the links below.


## Overview of the Telcommunication Accelerator
Telecommunications Accelerator focuses on “Subscriber Lead &  Geocoded Place Management” to enable network and mobile operators, Internet service providers, and other players in the space to better relate their services, products, and deployed plant and network resources to specific geocoded physical locations (i.e. buildings/dwelling/campuses) within and across their service areas. Improved and automated lead management with built-in service availability checks as well as resource and network mapping and address lookups are included in the two model-driven sample applications, one of which is standalone for address and network management ("Place Management") and one which integrates and expands the out-of-the-box Dynamics365 Sales application with the Telco entities ("Telco Sales").  The mapping features integrates directly with Azure Maps API. The Telco extension to the Common Data Model is based on the TM Forum Open Digital Framework for Geographic Site Management and creates 15 new telco-specific data entities and related attributes for fast application development.
